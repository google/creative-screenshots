# Creative Screenshots

**Please note: this is not an officially supported Google product.**

This is a solution to render screenshots for placements from GMP Campaign
Manager. It can take screenshots of an entire Campaign Manager Network. The
application can be deployed on Google Cloud Run. It can be configured to
generate n number of screenshots per placement.

Captured placements are stored in Datastore, so it can run daily without
re-rendering already covered placements.

Supported tags: * Display * VAST

The application will run through the following steps:<br />
* **List Advertisers**: Lists all advertisers available to the Profile
 (User Account) this solution is using.
* **List Placements**: Lists all placements per Advertiser
* **Generate Tags**: Generates a JS or VAST tag for each placement found.
 VAST tags are unwrapped and only the media file is processed.
* **Render Screenshot**: Loads the tag/media and takes n screenshots.
 Images are stored to Google Cloud Storage.

## Setup

### Cloud

#### Datastore

**Enable Google Cloud Datastore Service:** \
$ `gcloud services enable datastore.googleapis.com`

#### Cloud Tasks

The application makes use of different task queues:

Queue Name        | Maximum Rate | Maximum Concurrent
----------------- | ------------ | ------------------
list-advertisers  | 1/s          | 1
list-placements   | 5/s          | 5
generate-tags     | 5/s          | 25
render-screenshot | 5/s          | 40

To set up the queues as per above settings you can run the following commands:

**Enable Google Cloud Tasks Service:**<br />
\$ `gcloud services enable cloudtasks.googleapis.com`

**Create Queues:**<br />
\$ `gcloud tasks queues create list-advertisers --max-dispatches-per-second=1 --max-concurrent-dispatches=1`<br />
\$ `gcloud tasks queues create list-placements --max-dispatches-per-second=5 --max-concurrent-dispatches=5`<br />
\$ `gcloud tasks queues create generate-tags --max-dispatches-per-second=5 --max-concurrent-dispatches=25`<br />
\$ `gcloud tasks queues create render-screenshot --max-dispatches-per-second=5 --max-concurrent-dispatches=40`

[Additional documentation on creating Google Cloud Task Queues.](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/creating-queues)

#### Cloud Run

**Enable Google Cloud Datastore Service:** \
$ `gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com`

#### Cloud Storage

**Enable Google Cloud Storage Service:** \
$ `gcloud services enable storage-component.googleapis.com`

**Cloud Bucket** \
Create a Google Cloud Bucket where all images will be stored. \
$ `gsutil mb gs://[BUCKET_NAME]/` \
[Additional documentation on creating Google Cloud Buckets.](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/creating-buckets#storage-create-bucket-gsutil)

### Service Account
Create a new IAM Service Account with the following roles:
* Cloud Tasks Enqueuer
* Cloud Datastore User
* Storage Object Creator

**Enable Campgaign Manager API service:**<br />
\$ `gcloud services enable dfareporting.googleapis.com`


### Google Marketing Platform

Create a Campaign Manager User Profile with the service account's email address
with the respective role: * Agency Trafficker

Use the service account's email address you are using for the Cloud Run service.
By default this is the Compute Engine default service account.

## Deploy

There's two ways to deploy this solution, directly from the built image on
Google Cloud Container Registry or build and deploy from source.

By default, Cloud Run revisions are using the Compute Engine default service
account `(PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com)`. You can change
this identity. \
If you change it, make sure a Campaign Manager User Profile is created with this
service account email address.

### From GCR:
```
$ gcloud beta run deploy [SERVICE_NAME] \
--image gcr.io/creative-screenshots-external/creative-screenshots:stable \
--memory 2G \
--platform managed \
--service-account "[SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL]" \
--update-env-vars \
CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project),\
CLOUD_RUN_REGION=us-central1,\
CLOUD_BUCKET=creative-screenshots-test-output,\
FILE_PATH_PATTERN="{accountId}/{advertiserId}/{campaignId}/{placementId}_{index}.jpg",\
SCREENSHOT_PADDING=16,\
SCREENSHOT_QUALITY=100,\
MS_BEFORE_SCREENSHOT=1000,\
MS_BEFORE_SCREENSHOT_INSTREAM=8000,\
NUMBER_OF_SCREENSHOTS=1
```

### From Source:

To build the image use: \$ `npm run cloud-run-build`  
To deploy the built image: \$ `npm run cloud-run-deploy-only`  
To build and deploy: \$ `npm run cloud-run-deploy`  

## Configuration

When deploying the application from NPM you can update the configuration in
package.json under config, otherwise add it to the --update-env-vars of the
gcloud deploy command.
